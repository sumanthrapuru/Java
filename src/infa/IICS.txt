        steps
            1. definition
                insert operation
                    one time load of data

                update operation

                Advanced Filter
        Passive Transformation no change to no of rows
            Ex Expression Transformation
                Expression Field: can be used in downstream
                Variable Field: can't be used in downstream

            Union vs Join Transformation

        Mapplet Transformation
    Mapplets

        Source oracle define Query
        Select another source
        use joiner transformation
        use expression transformation    use expression transformation
            variable field PPU               variable field PPU
            variable field QTY               variable field QTY
            output field total               output field total
        filter                           filter < 1000
        target                           target

    Lookup Transformation
        lookup object
        lookup connection
        lookup condition
        return values

        Connected lookup vs unconnected lookup

    Aggregator Transformation
