    IICS is iPaaS (integration Platform as a Service)
    Terminologies
    IICS architecture
    Data Integration assets and components
    Cloud mapping designer (data integration loads)
    IICS Repository
        connection info

        Mappings
            Mapping
                create a mapping use it in mapping tasks
            Elastic Mapping
                uses for large data integration
        Mapplets
            Mapplet
                reusable transformation that can be reused in mapping
            Mapplet - power center import

            Hierarchical Schema
            Intelligent Structure model
                No structure data => structure parser transformation

            File Listener

2. Runtime environments and connections
    runtime environment
        Hosted agent(maintains cloud hosted env and agents)
        Secure agent(download into your env)
        Serverless runtime environment
    secure agent architecture(secure agent runs locally and connects to business api)
    secure agent log files
        session log C:\Program Files\Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\apps\Data_Integration_Server\logs
        error log C:\Program Files\Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\apps\Data_Integration_Server\data\error
        success log(if enabled) C:\Program Files\Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\apps\Data_Integration_Server\data\success
        infaagent (n/w connectivity) log C:\Program Files\Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\apps\agentcore\infaagent.log
        tomcat log(req res from integration server) C:\Program Files\Informatica Cloud Secure Agent\apps\Data_Integration_Server\logs\tomcat

    define connection
        salesforce
        flat file
        oracle
    types of connectors(native & add on connections)

3. Synchronization Task and Data transfer Task
    Synchronization Task
        integrate data between different sources
        csv file to account object in salesforce
        read data ; apply filter ; transform data
        steps
            1. definition
                insert operation
                    one time load of data

                update operation
                upsert operation
                delete operation
            2. Source
                single
                multiple
                saved query
            3. Target
            4. Data Filter
                Simple Filter
                Advanced Filter

            5. Field Mapping
                use exact name
                field properties
                refresh fields
                edit types and validate mapping
