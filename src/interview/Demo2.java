2. Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X",X, O],
                ["X","O","O","O",X, X],
                ["X","X","O","X",O, O],
                ["X","O","X","X",X, O]]
Output:    [["X","X","X","X", O],
            ["X","X","X","X", X],
            ["X","X","X","X", O],
            ["X","O","X","X", O]]
